This module enables authenticated users to download a batch of assignments feedbacks as a zip file
in the normal way, but if enabled the files in the zip will include the studentâ€™s qmul username as well as their student ID number in the filename.
This is only supposed to work if the blind marking setting is turned on in the assignment settings.
This removes the anonymity as the originial download link provided random numbers in the file name.
